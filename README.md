# Myntra HackerRamp
## Team Name - The PowerPuff Girls

This project was built for the **Myntra HackerRamp Hackathon** with the theme **The Hyper-Personalisation** and **The GenZ Way of Shopping** in mind. We mainly aim to increase customer involvement and satisfaction by integrating real-time social features into the shopping experience.

## Project Sub-Components
**1. Talk to AI Chabot** - An intelligent AI assistant that acts as a personal stylist, answers fashion queries, and helps users find products.

**2. TrendTalk Chat Feature** - A real-time chat powered by Socket.IO, allowing users to discuss trends and products, creating a vibrant community.

**3. AI Look Generation & Notifications** - A feature where the AI generates a complete look based on a selected item, and the user receives a notification when it's ready.
